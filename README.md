# Snake Game in Java with JavaFX

Welcome to the Snake Game project repository! This classic Snake Game is implemented in Java, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and JavaFX for the graphical user interface.

## Project Overview

The Snake Game is a simple and nostalgic game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the game boundaries. This project is a modern implementation of the Snake Game using Java and JavaFX.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design:** The game is designed using OOP principles, making the code modular, maintainable, and extensible.
- **JavaFX GUI:** The graphical user interface is created with JavaFX, providing an interactive and visually appealing gaming experience.
- **Scoring System:** The game keeps track of the player's score, updating it each time the snake consumes food.
- **Responsive Controls:** The snake is controlled using arrow keys, providing a smooth and responsive gaming experience.

## Getting Started

   ```

4. Use arrow keys to control the snake and enjoy the game!

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Java and JavaFX installed on your machine. You can download JavaFX from [https://openjfx.io/](https://openjfx.io/).

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a standard Java package structure:

- `src/main`: Contains the source code files.
- `com/snake`: Stores the main source code files that include game frame and panel.
- `resources/com/snakes`: Contains the resources used in game.
- `lib`: Constains the javafx files.
